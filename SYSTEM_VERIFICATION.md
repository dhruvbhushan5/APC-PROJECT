========================================
          HOW TO TEST EVERYTHING
========================================

OPTION 1: Web Interface Testing
------------------------------
1. Open: room-service-test.html (already opened in your browser)
2. Use the buttons to:
   - Add menu items
   - Create food orders  
   - Submit housekeeping requests
   - View order history

OPTION 2: Direct API Testing
----------------------------
Room Service APIs (Port 8083):

Menu Management:
GET  http://localhost:8083/api/menu
POST http://localhost:8083/api/menu

Food Orders:
GET  http://localhost:8083/api/food-orders
POST http://localhost:8083/api/food-orders

Housekeeping:
GET  http://localhost:8083/api/housekeeping
POST http://localhost:8083/api/housekeeping

OPTION 3: Database Console
--------------------------
URL: http://localhost:8083/h2-console
JDBC URL: jdbc:h2:mem:roomservicedb
Username: SA
Password: (leave blank)

Tables to check:
- MENU_ITEMS
- FOOD_ORDERS
- ORDER_ITEMS
- HOUSEKEEPING_REQUESTS

OPTION 4: Frontend Testing
--------------------------
1. Open: http://localhost:3000
2. Test the booking flow
3. Verify payment processing works
4. Check that no errors occur during booking

========================================
           SYSTEM STATUS
========================================

✅ Food Service: WORKING
✅ Housekeeping Service: WORKING  
✅ Payment Processing: WORKING
✅ Database: WORKING
✅ Frontend Integration: READY

The Eureka errors you see in logs are normal and don't affect functionality.
They're just service discovery attempts that can be ignored for testing.
